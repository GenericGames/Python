# Name Errors

A `NameError` is reported by the Python interpreter when it detects a variable that is unknown.

This can occur if a variable is used before it has been assigned a value or if a variable name is spelled differently than the point at which it was defined. The Python interpreter will display the line of code where the `NameError` was detected and indicate which name is found that was not defined.

Here‚Äôs an example of a `NameError` error message:

![error](https://i.imgur.com/fmPHMHX.png)

This error is suggesting that the variable `score` was never defined in the program. Oops.

Some common name errors are:

* Misspelling a variable name.
* Forgetting to define a variable.

### Original
```py
# Who Wants To Be A Millionaire üí∞

score = 0

option1 = 'Fresca'
option2 = 'V8'
option4 = 'A&W'

print("For ordering his favorite beverages on demand, LBJ had four buttons installed in the Oval Office labeled 'Coffee', 'Tea', 'Coke', and what?\n")

print("A.", option1)
print("B.", option2)
print("C.", option3)
print("D.", option4)

answer = 'a'

if answer == 'A' or answer == 'a':
  scor += 100
  print("\nCorrect!")
else:
  print("\nNope, sorry!")
```

### Instructions

In **script.py**, another teammate Alex wrote a Who Wants to Be A Millionaire question and four options. If the answer is an uppercase or lowercase ‚ÄúA‚Äù, then the score goes up.

Run the program to check it out.

Oh no, there are two `NameError` errors!

Can you find them both?

### Answer

```py
# Who Wants To Be A Millionaire üí∞

score = 0

option1 = 'Fresca'
option2 = 'V8'
option3 = "Water"
option4 = 'A&W'

print("For ordering his favorite beverages on demand, LBJ had four buttons installed in the Oval Office labeled 'Coffee', 'Tea', 'Coke', and what?\n")

print("A.", option1)
print("B.", option2)
print("C.", option3)
print("D.", option4)

answer = 'a'

if answer == 'A' or answer == 'a':
  score += 100
  print("\nCorrect!")
else:
  print("\nNope, sorry!")
