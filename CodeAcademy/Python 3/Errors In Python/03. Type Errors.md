# Type Errors

A `TypeError` is reported by the Python interpreter when an operation is applied to a variable of an inappropriate type.

This can occur in Python when one attempts to use an operator on something of the incorrect type.

For example, let‚Äôs see what happens when we try and add together two incompatible types:

```py
piggy_bank = '2' + 0.25
```

There will be an `TypeError` error message:

![error](https://i.imgur.com/uNUM82w.png)

This error is reporting that `0.25` is not a string.

Some common type errors are:

* Accidentally adding or subtracting a string value.
* Call a function on something of the incorrect type.

### Original

```py
# Area Calculator üìè

import math

base = 20
height = 30
area = base * height / 2

print("The triangle area is", area)

length = 2
width = 12
area = length * width

print("The rectangle area is" + area )

radius = 36
area = math.pi * radius * radius

print("The circle area is", area)
```

### Instructions

The word got out in the office that you are a pro bug catcher!

Another peer Alisha pops out of the blue and hands you a program that calculates the area of a triangle, a rectangle, and a circle.

Run the program to check it out.

Oh no, there‚Äôs one `TypeError` error!

Can you find it?

### Answer

```py
# Area Calculator üìè

import math

base = 20
height = 30
area = base * height / 2

print("The triangle area is", area)

length = 2
width = 12
area = length * width

print("The rectangle area is", area)

radius = 36
area = math.pi * radius * radius

print("The circle area is", area)
```
