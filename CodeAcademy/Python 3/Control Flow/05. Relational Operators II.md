# Relational Operators II

Now that we’ve added conditional statements to our toolkit for building control flow, let’s explore more ways to create boolean expressions. So far we know two relational operators, equals and not equals, but there are a ton (well, four) more:

`>` greater than
`>=` greater than or equal to
`<` less than
`<=` less than or equal to
Let’s say we’re running a movie streaming platform and we want to write a program that checks if our users are over 13 when showing them a PG-13 movie. We could write something like:

```py
if age <= 13:
  print("Sorry, parental control required")
```

This function will take the user’s age and compare it to the number 13. If `age` is less than or equal to 13, it will print out a message.

Let’s try some more!

### Instructions

Create an `if` statement that checks if `x` and `y` are equal, print the string below if so:

```txt
"These numbers are the same"
```

### Original

```py
x = 20
y = 20

# Write the first if statement here:



credits = 120

# Write the second if statement here:


```

### Answer

```py
