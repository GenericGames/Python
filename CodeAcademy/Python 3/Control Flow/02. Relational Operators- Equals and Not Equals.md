# Relational Operators: Equals and Not Equals

Now that we understand what boolean expressions are, let’s learn to create them in Python. We can create a boolean expression by using relational operators.

Relational operators compare two items and return either `True` or `False`. For this reason, you will sometimes hear them called comparators.

The two relational operators we’ll cover first are:

* Equals: `==`
* Not equals: `!=`

These operators compare two items and return `True` or `False` if they are equal or not.

We can create boolean expressions by comparing two values using these operators:

```py
1 == 1     # True

2 != 4     # True

3 == 5     # False

'7' == 7   # False
```

Each of these is an example of a boolean expression.

Why is the last statement false? The `''` marks in `'7'` make it a string, which is different from the integer value `7`, so they are not equal. When using relational operators it is important to always be mindful of type.

## Instructions

Determine if the following boolean expressions are `True` or `False`. Input your answer as `True` or `False` in the appropriate variable to the right.

Statement one:

```py
(5 * 2) - 1 == 8 + 1
```

Statement two:

```py
13 - 6 != (3 * 2) + 1
```

Statement three:

```py
3 * (2 - 1) == 4 - 1
```

### Original

```py
statement_one =

statement_two =

statement_three =
```

### Answer

```py
statement_one = True

statement_two = False

statement_three = True
```
