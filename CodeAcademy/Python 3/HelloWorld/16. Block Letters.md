# Block Letters

[ASCII art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_art) is a graphic design technique that uses computers for presentation and consists of pictures pieced together from individual characters.

Write a Python program called **initials.py** that displays the initials of your name in block letters as shown and dip your toes into ASCII art.

Happy coding!

## What we are building in this project:

Take a look at the [complete alphabet](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-cpp/hello-world/block-letters-hint.png) and find your initials. Notice how each block letter is 7x5 and formed by the letter itself.

My initials are S and L, so my **initials.py** program should output:
