# Growing a List: Plus (+)

When we want to add multiple items to a list, we can use `+` to combine two lists (this is also known as concatenation).

Below, we have a list of items sold at a bakery called `items_sold`:

```py
items_sold = ["cake", "cookie", "bread"]
```

Suppose the bakery wants to start selling `"biscuit"` and `"tart"`:

```py
items_sold_new = items_sold + ["biscuit", "tart"]
print(items_sold_new)
```

Would output:

```txt
['cake', 'cookie', 'bread', 'biscuit', 'tart']
```
In thi
s example, we created a new variable, `items_sold_new`, which contained both the original items sold, and the new items. We can inspect the original `items_sold` and see that it did not change:

```py
print(items_sold)
```

Would output:

```txt
['cake', 'cookie', 'bread']
```

We can only use `+` with other lists. If we type in this code:

```py
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_list + 4
```

we will get the following error:

```txt
TypeError: can only concatenate list (not "int") to list
```

If we want to add a single element using `+`, we have to put it into a list with brackets (`[]`):

```py
my_list + [4]
```

Let’s use `+` to practice combining two lists!

### Original

```py
orders = ["daisy", "buttercup", "snapdragon", "gardenia", "lily"]

# Create new orders here:



#broken_prices = [5, 3, 4, 5, 4] + 4
```

### Instructions

Jiho is updating a list of orders. He just received orders for `"lilac"` and `"iris"`.

Create a list called `new_orders` that contains our new orders.

Use `+` to create a new list called `orders_combined` that combines orders with `new_orders`.

Remove the `#` and whitespace in front of the list `broken_prices`. If you run this code, you’ll get an error:

```txt
TypeError: can only concatenate list (not "int") to list
```

Fix the command by inserting brackets (`[` and `]`) so that it will run without errors.

### Answer

```py
orders = ["daisy", "buttercup", "snapdragon", "gardenia", "lily"]

# Create new orders here:

new_orders = ["lilac", "iris"]

orders_combined = orders + new_orders

broken_prices = [5, 3, 4, 5, 4] + [4]
```
