# Growing a List: Append

We can add a single element to a list using the `.append()` Python method.

Suppose we have an empty list called `garden`:

```py
garden = []
```

We can add the element `"Tomatoes"` by using the `.append()` method:

```py
garden.append("Tomatoes")

print(garden)
```

Will output:

```txt
['Tomatoes']
```
We see that `garden` now contains `"Tomatoes"`!

When we use `.append()` on a list that already has elements, our new element is added to the **end** of the list:

```py
# Create a list
garden = ["Tomatoes", "Grapes", "Cauliflower"]

# Append a new element
garden.append("Green Beans")
print(garden)
```

Will output:

```py
['Tomatoes', 'Grapes', 'Cauliflower', 'Green Beans']
```

Letâ€™s use the `.append()` method to manipulate a list.

### Instructions

Jiho works for a gardening store called Petal Power. Jiho keeps a record of orders in a list called `orders`.

### Answer

```py
orders = ["daisies", "periwinkle"]
