# What is a List?

In programming, it is common to want to work with collections of data. In Python, a list is one of the many built-in [data structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure) that allows us to work with a collection of data in sequential order.

Suppose we want to make a list of the heights of students in a class:

* Noelle is 61 inches tall
* Ava is 70 inches tall
* Sam is 67 inches tall
* Mia is 64 inches tall

In Python, we can create a variable called heights to store these integers into a list:

```py
heights = [61, 70, 67, 64]
```

Notice that:

1. A list begins and ends with square brackets (`[` and `]`).
2. Each item (i.e., `67` or `70`) is separated by a comma (`,`)
3. It’s considered good practice to insert a space (` `) after each comma, but your code will run just fine if you forget the space.

Let’s write our own list!

## Original

```py
heights = [61, 70, 67, 64]

#broken_heights = [65 71 59 62]
```

### Instructions

Examine the existing list `heights` in your code editor.

A new student just joined the class!

* Chloe is 65 inches tall

Add Chloe’s height to the end of the list `heights`.

### Instructions

Remove the `#` in front of the definition of the list `broken_heights`. If you run this code, you’ll get an error in your terminal:


```py
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

Add commas (`,`) to `broken_heights` so that it runs without errors.

### Answer

```py
heights = [61, 70, 67, 64, 65]

broken_heights = [65, 71, 59, 62]
```
