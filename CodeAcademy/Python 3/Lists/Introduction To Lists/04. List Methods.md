# List Methods

As we start exploring lists further in the next exercises, we will encounter the concept of a method.

In Python, for any specific data-type ( strings, booleans, lists, etc. ) there is built-in functionality that we can use to create, manipulate, and even delete our data. We call this built-in functionality a method.

For lists, methods will follow the form of `list_name.method()`. Some methods will require an input value that will go between the parenthesis of the method `( )`.

An example of a popular list method is `.append()`, which allows us to add an element to the end of a list.

```py
append_example = [ 'This', 'is', 'an', 'example']
append_example.append('list')

print(append_example)
```

Will output:

```py
['This', 'is', 'an', 'example', 'list']
```

We will be exploring `.append()` and many other methods in the upcoming exercises but for now take a second to examine the graphic that lists a few common methods that exist in Python for lists.

### Original

```py
example_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]

#Using Append
example_list.append(5)
# print(example_list)

#Using Remove
example_list.remove(5)
# print(example_list)
```
